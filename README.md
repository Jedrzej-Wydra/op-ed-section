# Op-ed section

#### author: Jędrzej Wydra

## History

Life isn’t just about academic papers, data science, programming, and serious legal stuff. Sometimes, it’s nice to take a break and share a few thoughts about the world — or whatever comes to mind! This section is my collection of op-eds, where I’ve gathered random musings and essays that found their home on Medium (and, of course, there are a few hidden gems over there that you won’t find here). Occasionally, a few bonus materials lurk around. So, dive in for a light read and enjoy the break from the heavy lifting of science and code!
